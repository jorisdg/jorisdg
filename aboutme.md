My name is Joris de Gruyter, and I'm a Belgian living and working in the United States of America. Programming and technology has been
a passion of mine from an early age, and I am one of those fortunate people who has turned their passion into a day job.<br/>
Microsoft Dynamics AX and related technologies is my work life. I accidentally stumbled into the "Axapta" world back in 2002 (AX 2.5), around the time
Microsoft bought the product. Since then, I have worked for several ISVs and VARs on AX implementations in Belgium, The Netherlands, England,
Luxemburg, Italy and across the USA. In 2006 I moved to the USA where I initially worked for a large
accounting and technology firm managing a team of Dynamics AX developers working on customer projects. Currently I work as a senior solution architect
at Microsoft's Dynamics R&D division. My job consists of working with signature customers, TAP customers, speak at conferences, and bring all the knowledge
I gain from my interactions with customers and partners back to the product team and drive new features and improvements.<br />
Due to my work, any Microsoft technologies that come across my desk grab my attention and will get some one-on-one time at some point. It's difficult to stay
current on technology these days, but one tries.<br/>
In the good ol' days of college, and even early in my professional carreer, when free time existed and hobbies reigned, web development using
PHP and MySQL and OpenGL development in C++ on Linux platforms were what kept me up at night. Some day I will have time for that again. Sure.
For now, one of my favorite hobbies is game development. I used to create my own engines in C++ and OpenGL, these days (with less free time to spend)
I opt for Unity 3D as an easy way to get things started.<br />
<br/>
I am also a former Microsoft Certified Trainer in Microsoft Dynamics AX Development. In July 2012, 2013 and 2014 I received
the Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) Award for my Dynamics AX community contributions.<br/>
